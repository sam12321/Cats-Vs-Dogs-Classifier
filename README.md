# Cats-Vs-Dogs-Classifier
In this project we create CNN(Convolution neural network) to classify if the given image is of a cat or a dog
# Goal
Our main goal in this project is to create a convolutional-neural network and train it using the training set so that it can successfully predict if any given image
is of a cat or a dog.
# Datasets
The data contains two directories which contain images of cats and dogs.We need to create a dataset within the program itself using these directories.Don't worry the process is
quite simple and shown in the program.ðŸ˜€
